1. INTRODUCTION
The Personal  Budget Tracker helps people to manage their monthly budget. It let’s users divide their money into different categories and see how much they spend. If they’re spending too much, the system will suggest ways to fix it and stay on track.

2. OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to
•	Help users divide their monthly budget into different categories based on importance.
•	Allow users to track their actual spending in each category.
•	Compare the user’s spending to their budget.
•	Suggest ways to adjust and save money if the user is going over budget.
3. FUNCTIONALITY
Here are the main things the system can do
•	Allocate Budget: The system automatically suggests how much to spend in each category based on its importance.
•	Track Expenses: Users can enter their actual spending and see how it compares to the suggested budget.
•	Warn About Overspending: The system will alert users if they’ve spent more than their budget and suggest changes to get back on track.
•	Lock Categories: Users can lock certain categories, which means those amounts won’t be adjusted when the system tries to fix the budget.
•	Adjust Expenses: If the user is over budget, the system will suggest lowering expenses in the categories that aren’t locked.
•	Final Report: After making adjustments, the system shows a summary of the spending and how much money is left in the budget.

4. TECHNOLOGY STACK
The project uses
•	Programming Language: C++ 
•	Tools: 
o	A code editor like Visual Studio Code
o	A C++ compiler like GCC to run the program

5. PROJECT WORKFLOW
Here’s how the system works
1.	Enter Budget: The user first types in their total monthly budget.
2.	Category Setup: The user defines different expense categories and how important each category is (in percentages).
3.	Suggested Budget: The system calculates how much money should go to each category based on its importance.
4.	Track Spending: The user enters their actual spending for each category.
5.	Adjust if Needed: If the user has spent more than their total budget, the system will suggest how to adjust expenses. Users can lock certain categories if they don’t want those to change.
6.	Final Check: The user checks the final summary of their expenses and remaining budget.
